I've created a web application called "TaskMaster" to help users manage their tasks and projects efficiently. Here's an overview of the features and components:

Main App (App.tsx):

Manages the overall state of tasks and projects
Provides a header with the app title and buttons to add tasks and projects
Renders the TaskList and ProjectList components
Handles the display of AddTaskModal and AddProjectModal
TaskList (TaskList.tsx):

Displays a list of tasks
Allows users to toggle task completion and delete tasks
Uses Lucide React icons for visual feedback
ProjectList (ProjectList.tsx):

Displays a list of projects
Shows project names and descriptions
AddTaskModal (AddTaskModal.tsx):

Provides a form to add new tasks
Includes fields for task title and description
AddProjectModal (AddProjectModal.tsx):

Provides a form to add new projects
Includes fields for project name and description
Types (types.ts):

Defines TypeScript interfaces for Task and Project
The application uses Tailwind CSS for styling, creating a clean and modern user interface. The layout is responsive and should work well on both desktop and mobile devices.

To use the application:

Click the "Add Task" button to create a new task
Click the "Add Project" button to create a new project
Use the checkboxes next to tasks to mark them as complete
Click the "X" icon to delete a task
This application provides a solid foundation for task and project management. You can further enhance it by adding features such as:

Persistence (e.g., using localStorage or connecting to a backend API)
Drag-and-drop functionality for reordering tasks
Due dates and priority levels for tasks
Filtering and sorting options for tasks and projects
User authentication and multi-user support
The development server is now running, and you can view the application in the preview.
